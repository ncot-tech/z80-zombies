# z80-zombies

A conversion of a BASIC type in game to the RC2014 Z80 computer

## How to use

You will need an [RC2014 computer](https://rc2014.co.uk/), or other Z80 computer running [Small Computer Monitor 1.0](https://smallcomputercentral.wordpress.com/small-computer-monitor/small-computer-monitor-v1-0/).

You will also need a [joystick module](https://rc2014.co.uk/modules/joystick-module/) that is mapped to Z80 input port 1.

You can upload the Intel HEX format binary (zombies.hex) to the machine through the serial terminal.

The game uses ANSI colours, so make sure your terminal is set to interpret those.

Execution starts at 0x8000
